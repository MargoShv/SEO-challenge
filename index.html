    <h1>ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Macaron</h1>
    <p>
      A macaron or French macaroon is a sweet meringue-based confection made
      with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond meal, and food
      colouring. The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in
      France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine de Medici during the
      Renaissance. Since the 19th century, a typical Parisian-style macaron is
      presented with a ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between
      two such cookies, akin to a sandwich cookie. The confection is
      characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled circumferenceâ€”referred to
      as the "crown" or "foot" (or "pied")â€”and a flat base. It is mildly moist
      and easily melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of
      flavours that range from traditional (raspberry, chocolate) to unusual
      (foie gras, matcha).
